# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm excited that I created **my first ever** multiplayer game - Tic Tac Toe! ðŸ”¥ 
thanks to the awesome SocketIO library - which makes creating live-chats and multiplayer games like this so much easier. ðŸ¤© 

*Just be sure though that both the client-side and backend-side versions of SocketIO are exactly the same, otherwise small but really annoying glitches will happen.*

So, in this game you'll be connected to a random player and get to challenge them! By the way it also includes a message board on the top left to chat with your opponent ðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ®
